The other day poor Bill sloped on his sofa, pondering away. 'I've always thought myself so unappealing to women. But it's now occured to me, I'm in good shape, I'm relatively handsome,
I'm successful at my job, I have a nice dick, I cook well, I adore children, I eat fantastic pussy, I'm kind to animals, I pen an occasionally catchy love song, and I shoot 3's like I was
Walter Ray Allen Jr. Why did I have it so wrong all these years?'

Bill then intercoursed ten thousand women, ravishing and ravished to the last. He overtook Mt. Kilimanjaro like it was Mt. fuckin' Turkey and, having caught his musk, there awaited ten thousand more.

We aren't what others say we are, because nobody knows us like we do. We are what we say we are, what we feel we can be, and there'll be no goddamn denying it.
